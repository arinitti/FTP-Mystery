<h1>FTP Mystery</h1>
<p>
Hiding in plain sight, FTP can be used to change ownership of files. In researching the net, I have not found any documentation or mention regarding this possible security hole.
 FTP is used by thousands daily. Why is this problem overlooked? FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol) are both impacted by this permissions mystery.</p>
