<h1>FTP Mystery</h1>
<p>
Hiding in plain sight, FTP can be used to change file ownership and permissions. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol) are both impacted by this mystery. 
In researching the net, I have not found any documentation or mention regarding this possible security danger. FTP is used by thousands daily. Is this problem overlooked? Did the documentation disappear in rewrites? Who knows?
